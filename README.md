# Project Background
Founded in 2016, Row Health is a medical insurance company serving over thousands of customers throughout the United States. In 2019, they launched a new set of marketing campaign categories spanning topics like wellness tips, the affordability of their plans, and preventative care. Their customers can sign up for 4 different plans - bronze, silver, gold, and platinum - each with different premiums and claim coverage rates.

Row Health would like to build a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of these campaign categories and how they relate to signups and subsequent patient claims. These insights will guide their marketing budget strategy for the upcoming year. The budget is allocated to drive two primary objectives: 1) to increase the number of customer signups, and 2) to raise awareness of Row Healthâ€™s brand across the country.

The following key metrics were used to the evaluate the performance of the campaigns.

- **Click through Rate (CTR):** The percent of people who see a campaign and click on the associated link.
- **Cost per Click (CPC):** The average dollars spent per click on people who see a campaign and click on the associated link.
- **Signup Rate:** The percent of people who see a campaign and subsequently sign up for a Row Health plan.
- **Cost per Signup:** The average dollars spent in order to acquire a signup from each campaign.

# Insights Deep-Dive
### Click through Rate (CTR)
- Across categories, Health for All and Benefit Updates performed nearly 3-4x better than the average CTR at 36% and 22%, respectively.
- Within the two categories with high CTR, product promotion-based campaigns had relatively low CTR (0% and 7%).
- Family Coverage Plan had high impressions but no clicks - this needs to be investigated and could be due to missing data or issues with the campaign.

### Cost per Click (CPC)
- #CoverageMatters" had the lowest average CPC at approximately $0.03, indicating highly cost-effective engagement.
- #HealthyLiving" and "Preventive Care News" had moderate CPC values of $0.17 and $0.13 respectively, balancing cost and engagement.
- Campaigns under "#InsureYourHealth" and "Compare Health Coverage" showed higher CPCs of $0.34 and $0.33, suggesting these categories may require more investment per click.
  
### Signup Rate
- Across campaign categories, Health for All campaigns had the best-performing signup rate (2.9%) and the second-highest number of signups (3.5K).
- This high signup rate is due to the Health Awareness campaign type, which had by far the highest signup rate across all campaign types (3.72%).
- Interestingly, the category with the highest number of signups - #HealthyLiving - had a comparably low signup rate at 0.3%.

### Cost per Signup
- Across campaign categories, Golden Years Security had by far the highest cost per signup ($124), as well as the lowest number of signups (23), compared to an average of $2.2.
- Within the two campaign categories with highest cost per signup, info-based campaign types (like offers and policy info) drove high costs per signup.
